## My Process

I started with the HTML structure, then I made de styles to fit the requirements. I did mobile first design, and then, expanded it to desktop design using query params

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I the pair works, my parner use a diferent form to write the code, and I can learn a lot diferents propertys and forms to make a proyect. The media querys is a element that rarelly use in my personal proyects, so donÂ´t have practis to do it, this exercise help me a lot to do it and learn betters practics.
### Continued development
when i start to stude others lenguages, use a lot less lenguages like HTML and CSS, and I can see teams to need practice and stude more.
